More\n            and more funding organisations and publishers will actually request that. This is in itself a reasonably\n            straightforward process, as such public archives are usually maintained by dedicated institutes or consortia\n            and these have rules, regulations, requested formats and in many cases clear instructions in how to upload\n            and retrieve your data. Please note that also here, some environments with be ‘inert’ non-interoperable\n            archive (or only meant to serve human re-use) and some may qualify as HPR environments, which may pose quite\n            some different challenges for you as a data creator (see also earlier consideration on updates and\n            versioning of growing or changing data sets or resources).</p>\n        <p>A more detailed consideration may be whether you consider your data ‘reference’ data that may be offered for\n            curation and including the addition to core data resources such as UniProt. In that case the procedures may\n            be quite different and an active interaction with the core data resource custodians is in many cases the way\n            to go. Currently, many of these resources have to painstakingly recover the data they want to use in their\n            curated and value-added resource by <em>ocular extraction</em> (reading) or by text and data mining, both of\n            which is cumbersome and error prone.

However, there is a data stewardship edge to this question as well. First\n            of all, it is obviously very important to discuss in step 1 with the best statistician you have access to\n            the nature and the (sample) size of the data you need to answer the question. That is as far as the newly\n            generated data for the experiment at hand is concerned. What is a very important data stewardship aspect\n            here is that in data driven research, very frequently OPEDAS or multiple novel data sets need to be\n            collectively analysed to get the sought-for answers. So, next to the ‘data-intrinsic’ aspects of size, scope\n            and quality of your data sets and the experimental versus control aspects, there is a serious challenge in\n            functional integration or linking with other data.

These algorithms are very different from those that ‘know the data\n            type they are running over’ and therefore are strictly programmed to follow particular instructions\n            reproducibly. Machine learning is usually employed in computing tasks where designing and programming\n            explicit algorithms is infeasible. This obviously has impact on the required quality of the data.\n            Intuitively, you may think that the ‘machine will figure out’ what it is looking at, and that the FAIR\n            principles do not so much apply to the type of data that are used as input for machine learning. Granted,\n            the data elements themselves may be ‘unstructured’ (for instance a x-ray image) and thus intrinsically not\n            FAIR. However, in this case the quality and FAIR elements of the annotations as part of the metadata may be\n            even more critical than in cases where the data elements themselves are directly machine actionable and\n            ‘understandable’ by the machine. For instance, if an algorithm is designed to learn from patterns and\n            colours in images, proper context of in what category the image should be placed is extremely important and\n            can be part of its machine actionable metadata. So again, clearly distinguish between the three categories\n            of data defined earlier: Intrinsic metadata, user defined metadata and the data elements (including the\n            ‘raw’ data themselves.

This goes beyond the formatting and identifier related consistency of the data\n            themselves. The fact that we handle this issue under the interpretation and analysis section indicates that\n            this has everything to do with‘what the data will be used for.

Two examples:\n            It may soon become cheaper to ‘re-sequence’ a genome than to store it for 10 years. Also text mining the\n            same massive corpus of text with the same tagger and the same thesaurus, should in principle give the exact\n            same result when repeated at any time.

First of all, the technology should not change; sequencers get more reliable by the\n            day and therefore may give different results and the ‘old sequencer’ may not be in your possession anymore\n            by the time you want to generate the results. Workflows are not necessarily stable but more importantly even\n            ‘stable’ substrates (a genome of a living individual or a corpus of text) may not be as stable as you think.\n            Changes to a text corpus may occur unbeknownst to you, but also, the somatic mutation rate in the genome of\n            a living organism are not insignificant and therefore a new sample of cells to take DNA from may give\n            different results and even if the DNA sample was stored in ‘preserved state’ there is no absolute guarantee\n            that later re-sequencing of it will give exactly the same result. So in all cases, the decision to\n            ‘regenerate versus store’ is a deep-scientific method discussion in the group and not a ‘trivial\n            decision’</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Consider all angles of the problem including deep domain knowledge issues like exemplified above when\n                a decision for regeneration of ‘identical’ data is to be considered.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Only consider this option if the long term preservation is problematic due to size/costs or other\n                aspects.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Always keep careful records of whether data are indeed ‘exactly the same’ (as far as that can ever be\n                guaranteed) or ‘supposedly the same but regenerated from the same substrate with the same methods.</p>\n            </li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Lightly assume that data can be easily regenerated even if that seems to be apparent with only\n                superficial knowledge of the scientific subject.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Re-generate data and archive them under the same PID as the original data set, assuming that there\n                will be no differences.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"links\">\n        <h2>Links</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><a href=\"https://github.com/DSQResources/DSQ-ixr\" target=\"_blank\">DS Question GitHub resources repository: ixr</a></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n</div>"

One of the issues with re-using other\n            people’s’ data is that they cannot be assumed to be reusable from an ethical or legal standpoint without\n            explicit permission. Assuming that unlicensed data are ‘free to use for whatever purpose’ is intrinsically\n            wrong, and in the case of for instance Pharmaceutical industry can lead to court cases later on. Therefore,\n            whenever you publish a data set or any other kind of information or digital object, it is important to\n            define a license for reuse. For software many licences exist, and for data, increasingly, standard licenses\n            are available or under development. Please note that a given license is also a defined concept and therefore\n            deserves a Persistent Identifier and a URI pointing to where the license can be studied (machine readable\n            licenses are also under development in some areas). This means that in the metadata, the license under which\n            the data or the workflow can be reused is ‘just another PID in the right place’. Users can then specify in\n            their search or workflow container that ‘only data with the following licenses should be included’.</p>\n        <p>For instance, if you include some data in your analysis that cannot be used for commercial purposes, that\n            decision may render your entire results not usable for commercial purposes (at least in the view of some\n            lawyers). This means that not licensing your data at all, even if you don’t care who uses them and for what\n            purpose is very counterproductive and will severely undermine the actual reuse of your data by others and in\n            particular by industry. It will also lower the attribution-rate (usually part of the license conditions) and\n            thus the citation and the impact score of your data.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Always carefully choose a license to be attached to your data upon publication.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Include and clearly mark the licences PID as a concept + attributes in the metadata.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Store and ‘expose’ the license as part of the metadata in Open Access environments where search\n                engines can easily find the license, even of the data they describe are not (yet) FAIR or even highly\n                restricted in access.

Choose a proper\n            persistent identifier approach to attach a persistent, machine resolvable identifier to each\n            concept-denoting term.

In addition to those unintended changes, not all data and information is ‘static’ in nature. For\n            instance, annotations of samples may have to change when the samples change. Having been taken out of frozen\n            storage for instance may change characteristics and this has to be recorded.

However, to\n            be the basis of reproducible results based on the same data, the workflow and all elements it uses (such as\n            for instance thesauri for text mining, lists of reference data etc. need to be exactly the same. However, in\n            many cases one or more of the components are not well documented, maintained or versioned (people you do not\n            control decide on updates without even informing you). So, consider writing new software or algorithms for\n            data analysis without the need to as a first capital sin for good data stewardship. Unless you are the very\n            first to run a particular type of experiment, more likely than not software and workflows/pipelines for the\n            type of processing and analysis you need will already exist.</p>\n        <p>Even if you use ‘existing’ Open Source (OS) software produced in your scientific community, verify first that\n            there is proper support, versioning and documentation about the code. If not, you run a serious risk to run\n            into irreparable reproducibility problems very soon. In many cases, workflow decay in the public sector is a\n            very serious problem. Next to that, many OS workflows are based on serial running of web service-type\n            components. If one of those is ‘off-line’ or changed (without proper management and notice) your workflow\n            will either not run properly or give unexplainable variations in results. It is therefore of the utmost\n            importance and core business for data stewards to ensure that the software components you decide to use are\n            of sufficient stability and quality to take the risk to subject your valuable data to them. Even for\n            commercially provided and professionally engineered software and pipelines, there is always the risk that\n            the company supporting the tool will have suboptimal versioning and support agreements in oplace and/or\n            disappear from the scene.

This is not a trivial issue. For some large data\n            sets it is far from easy or cheap to ‘just keep everything’. So the first consideration here is to determine\n            which phases of the data generated and processed need to be ‘kept-forever-in-principle’. This means that\n            even in the process of generation and processing of the data there might be already files that can\n            responsibly be disposed of. next, some data can be ‘zipped’ in the sense that they can be stored in a\n            reduced format that allows to reconstruct the richer format without information loss or the introduction of\n            errors. An example of such a steward-decision is the question to either store the entire sets of reads and\n            the full imputed genome sequence of an organism as opposed to just the ‘variations from the reference\n            genome’.</p>\n        <p>In addition to these early process decisions, there may be a point when archived data appear to be not\n            re-usable anymore.

This is not only\n            pertaining to to scientific realms, but is critically addressed in next generation solutions to bitcoin,\n            blockchain and other approaches. The essence of the Internet is local transactions that are internally and\n            intrinsically robust (including accepting error prone issues and redundancy only where redundancy makes\n            sense). This trend will rapidly influence ‘local’ versus ‘distributed’ compute and learning. So in any case,\n            for a small or a large study, you have to consider the possibilities of local versus distributed computing.\n            The options range literally from using smart-phones to distributed supercomputers heating homes and\n            connected via glass fiber to exascale computer facilities. It is not a ‘given’ anymore that massive compute\n            and analysis jobs have to be done centrally and within firewalls even when sensitive data are involved. If\n            we define the ‘cloud’ as ‘other people’s computers’ in general, most of what you need to do may be perfectly\n            feasible ‘in the cloud’. However, there may be reasons to do things locally and maintain expensive compute\n            infrastructure. Still, never buy locally maintained hardware if there are better and cheaper options ‘just\n            for the sake of controlling it’. No-one would generate electricity or clean water anymore unless as a backup\n            generator or in case the water needs to be of exceptional quality that can not be delivered from external\n            sources. Compute and Storage rapidly becomes such a ‘general commodity’ and using it externally or in the\n            ‘cloud’ becomes a major issue to address. The core question is: how much ‘compute’ capacity needs to be\n            immediately associated with the data. Recognising the speed of current connections in your network is\n            obviously a major aspect here. This again pertains to whether you plan to send massive data sets over\n            networks (where network speed may still be a major cost and time issue) or ‘light weight’ workflow\n            containers that visit data <em>in situ</em> to do relatively restricted compute job.</p>\n        <p>There are emerging trends that show that many more scientific questions can be answered by distributed\n            analytics and learning than we would intuitively believe. Therefore it is considered bad data stewardship if\n            you burden our institution with internal hardware and software issues that can be done by trusted third\n            parties much better, cheaper and safer.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Study and consult carefully on cloud based options for the storage and compute you will need.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li><p>Compare different cloud services providers for pricing, service and security (bigger is not always\n                better).</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make sure you are allowed to ‘send data around’ before going down that path.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Consider that up- and download pricing of regular cloud providers will be very considerable of you\n                deal with really large data sets.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Balance the costs you will be incurring using a cloud provider with the costs of local facilities</p>\n            </li>\n            <li><p>Calculate the risks of procurement, maintenance, support, expertise, and renewal of machinery and\n                infrastructure in your own institution as well.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Choose the right local/distributed approach for each individual workspace and ‘batch’ of analysis\n                (not a one size-fits-all approach).</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Just assume that the storage and data processing will be done ‘in house’ without a very strong\n                justification for that (major costs and logistics involved).</p></li>\n            <li><p>Buy or hire much more computer space and power than you actually need.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Consider every compute job a ‘compute and data are altogether’ situation.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Confuse ‘large scale compute problems’ with ‘large scale’ local infrastructure.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"links\">\n        <h2>Links</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><a href=\"https://github.com/DSQResources/DSQ-wia\" target=\"_blank\">DS Question GitHub resources repository: wia</a></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n</div>"

In addition, there may be privacy, legal or commercial restrictions that prevent the\n            data from physically leaving your internal repository’. These issues are extremely important to be carefully\n            studied at the early stage of data generation, as they may influence your generation, licensing and\n            stewardship choices. If data cannot be ‘shipped’ the environment in which you offer them for reuse is\n            critically important. A ‘download server’ where people can just ‘take the data for their purpose’ is very\n            different from a place where ‘workflows’ (compute elements) can come in and do their calculations and\n            analytics on your data set locally. Security and authentication issues (here pertaining to visiting\n            workflows) are very different and also there should be sufficient compute power directly associated with the\n            data for the workflows to do their work efficiently.

Here we re-introduce the term ‘data publishing’. As we should treat\n            re-usable data sets with the same care as we are used to for research articles, we need to make sure that\n            optimal use by others, citation and sustainability are all covered and properly budgeted for. For research\n            articles, it has long been accepted that external parties take part (for a fee in Open Access) in the\n            formatting, redaction, peer review, publishing and preservation of your narrative article and the\n            accompanying resources (supplements). Think about data in the same way. They are a valuable output of your\n            research and should be ‘published’ in their own right, regardless of any articles (sometimes more than one)\n            you might want to base on the data. Obviously, the description of the data should be rich enough to make\n            them actually re-usable by others. That means aspects of Findability (including good metadata and a\n            persistent identifier), Accessibility (Open Access, restricted, license as well as ‘download-ability’ or\n            ‘<em>in situ</em> accessibility’ for analytics. In the ‘article’ sphere, interoperability of the outcome was\n            largely related to ‘readability for other human users’ and this again is largely confined to proper\n            language, rhetoric and formatting, issues that are usually co-judged and improved in the ‘peer-review’\n            process. However, interoperability of data is more complicated. Text is a nightmare for computers as we\n            already described, so machine readable and actionable met data formats and data formats are critical. For\n            most data types standard formats, and increasingly also metadata format are available and these should be\n            used wherever possible. Human reviewers will increasingly be unable to ‘check every line’ of your big data\n            sets and therefore will have to rely on the formats and standards you used. We expect more and more\n            computable ‘quality check and integrity check’ tools in the data space but these are not yet available for\n            all data types.</p>\n        <p>This all means that your study plan (or proposal) should adequately budget for data publication in FAIR\n            format. Tools are under development to certify your (meta-)data as FAIR but these are in their infancy and\n            therefore you may need to spend considerable time, effort and funds to get your data in the correct format,\n            to have it checked and to actually publish it. The good news is that these publishing costs are mostly\n            ‘eligible costs’ in research proposals and they also include the long-term archiving of these data. One data\n            are in the correct format and ‘static’ in size and shape, the long-term storage can usually be easily\n            budgeted and justified.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Carefully budget for the publication of your data.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Check various data publishing providers and check whether they are trustworthy (for instance\n                approved/certified by the funder of your research).</p></li>\n            <li><p>Compare prices of different publishers and specifically also whether they include long-term\n                preservation of the published data.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Restrict this part of your budgeting effort to the actual ‘archiving’ as a basic preservation\n                cost.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Budget separately for potential storage and copies of the data in HPR environment, which might be\n                very worthwhile to increase reuse and citations on your data and thus ‘impact’.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Check whether your institution has a data access committee or an equivalent body.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Mix one-off formatting, review, quality checks etc. with real ‘publishing’ of the data in a format\n                and environment that will make the FAIR (with again the main consideration being machines, the prime\n                ‘users’ of digital large data sets.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Assume that an Open Source, Open Access Academic repository is always the best option for the funder\n                and the actual reuse of your data.

These aspects have been covered in general terms before but here we need to emphasize that\n            it is your task as a data steward to prevent unexpected capacity problems in hardware, but also human\n            capacity that may cause delays or even waste of generated data once the experiments have been set in motion.\n            This does not only cover the capturing of the raw data, although this is the most urgent issue to address.\n            You should also be fully aware of the stability of data and samples generated in each step of the\n            experimental process. In many cases, samples taken from physical or biological systems for example have a\n            very limited stability and measurements on them can be heavily influenced by the time lapse between the time\n            point at which the sample was taken and the time the actual measurement of its features and values took\n            place. Again, this is mainly a part of general good research practice and the co-responsibility of the\n            entire team, but your role as a data steward is to maximally ensure that variations that may be traceable to\n            time-lapse or other experimental conditions are properly recorded and therefore traceable. For instance the\n            exact position of each sample in the container used for measurements (for instance a 96-well plate) and the\n            time it took to run the entire plate through the measurement procedure can prove to be extremely important\n            for later processing and analysis of the data. If it is well established that for instance fluorescence of a\n            marker has a given decay over time, differences between the first well in the plate and the last one may\n            have to be corrected for that before the data can be processed further to be meaningful.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Make sure you fully understand the ‘sources of potential variance’ that are relevant for the\n                experimental study at hand and that you advise the research team on which metadata and process\n                descriptive data have to be captured to minimise risk of data loss or lack of harmonisation, calibration\n                and correction procedures.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Capture all reasonably possible metadata and data about laboratory procedures again following the\n                ‘better- throw-away-than-regret-not-to-have’ principle.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Ensure that correction, harmonisation and calibration procedures on the data are also considered as\n                part of the experimental process and therefore monitored and captured as such.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Consider yourself out of loop during the actual experiment and see yourself merely as the recipient\n                of the data when they come out of the experimental workflow process.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Consider the deep knowledge about experimental procedures (not necessarily the hypothesis being\n                tested or generated) none of your business and the realm of the experimentalist, but act as an intrinsic\n                member of the research team, also during this step of the data cycle.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Start the actual data capture process without the best possible knowledge about the future use of the\n                data and the requirements to be able to compare them with OPEDAS without cumbersome and error prone <em>post\n                    hoc</em> harmonization processes.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n</div>"

As discussed in section 4, for most data types\n            and metadata needs there will be earlier examples, community emerging standards and publication as well as\n            linking, integration and analytics workflows that can handle FAIR data.</p>\n        <p>As of 2014, a growing series of so called ‘Bring Your Own Data workshops have been organised where data\n            owners of various basic data types have worked with FAIR data experts to represent their original data in a\n            FAIR manner at the metadata level and in many cases also to turn (part of) of their core data into FAIR\n            format. In most cases this procedure did not<em>replace</em> their original database, but it merely exposed\n            part of their data in a FAIRpoint, meaning that FAIR-aware tools will find them and will be able to operate\n            in that subset of the data. By the time you read this book, many data types will have been ‘done before’ and\n            an increasing number of concepts you will have to refer to in your (meta)data will be covered by community\n            compliant and supported vocabularies. There are international efforts and research infrastructures in most\n            domains that are in full swing to develop tools, standards and best practices for their domain where these\n            do not exist. Granted there may be large differences in maturity of data type registries, proper, controlled\n            vocabularies, mapping services between those and ontologies  dependent on the scientific domain, but\n            increasingly, front line research will have to link and meta-analyse data from different domains and\n            disciplines. It is therefore imperative for interdisciplinary and open science that your data ‘talk\n            optimally’ to other data within your domain and also to data from other domains. Therefore, your search for\n            ‘pre-existing best practices, formats and standards’ should not stop at your disciplinary border. One of the\n            best approaches to get acquainted with best practices of the data type you have at hand is to turn to\n            establish research infrastructures in your domain or consult certified data stewardship nodes in your\n            domain, or for instance the Research Data Alliance.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Consult experts, preferably associated with established research infrastructures in your domain.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li><p>Consult also outside your domain (there may be a vocabulary in agriscience you may want to extend for\n                a biodiversity project, or one in meteorology you may be able to use for part of your geology data, as\n                well as one in chemistry that may cover the metabolites you want to refer to).</p></li>\n            <li><p>Detect concepts or formats that you need and for which no appropriate ‘prior art’ is Findable or\n                Re-usable in your specific case.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Always approach research infrastructures or services (like ELIXIR, NCBO or EPOS) for advice.

However, there might\n            be several (and rapidly accumulating) reasons to choose for a HPR environment anyway. First, in case you are\n            internally rewarded for the reuse of your data (unfortunately only a fledgling practice to date) there may\n            be great benefits in choosing a HPR, as the chances that others will actually reuse and cite your data will\n            be naturally (much) higher. Second, the participation in a FAIR HPR environment may give you extremely\n            valuable feedback on your data over time. Not only through reuse <em>per se</em>, but for instance also\n            through annotation (by others) and by progressing insight created through other people’s research that may\n            reveal new patterns or associations in your data that may lead to further insights, claims and publications.\n            Therefore, considering the much higher costs to offer the data yourself in a HPR or ‘submit them to one of\n            the emerging HPR environments is a worthwhile exercise. In many cases, private providers will be eager to\n            include your data in HPR environments they provide (such as highly performant analytics graphs and\n            visualisations), this may sometimes only pertain to part of your data, but it could expose your data in\n            multiple HPR environments without you bearing the costs of the provision in those environments. The HPR\n            provider makes a living by re-formatting, analysing, linking and integrating your data with OPEDAS and\n            although the data as such as open and freely delivered to the HPR provider, an entire market on value added\n            services around data is rapidly developing while you read.</p>\n        <p>In case you decide with the team that running your own HPR is not within your reach for technical, expertise,\n            support or financial reasons, you may still consider to offer them formally for reuse in an existing HPR\n            environment (Open Access or commercial). In other words consider the ‘value’ of your data up to the point\n            where they may be an asset for commercial HPR providers in the cloud that may help you in publication (for\n            free) in their desired format or even pay you for your data.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Carefully consider the pro- and cons of HPR provision of your published (metadata)</p></li>\n            <li><p>Clearly distinguish between ‘local’ HPR environments (very costly) and joining an existing HPR\n                provider where you let them offer your data in the desired format.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Discuss the ‘value’ of your data in the team, with your supervisors and make sure that due credit is\n                given once your data actually does get reused and cited.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Lightly assume that just publishing your data (albeit FAIR) in an ‘inert’ repository is always just\n                enough to claim good data stewardship.

The term ‘publishing’ has its roots in the notion of\n            making assets (traditionally text or images) ‘public’. No matter how much this term has undergone semantic\n            drift in the current scholarly ‘publishing’ practice, we wish to stick to the original notion. So data\n            archived in your local repository are not automatically ‘published’.  There may be a very good reason to\n            keep them just ‘archived’ for internal reuse (obviously with all backup and safety issues discussed earlier,\n            but here we assume that you want to really publish your data for external reuse. These costs should be\n            eligible for the funder of your research and are comparable in nature to the APC for Open Access articles.\n            However, it is not the responsibility of the creator of the data to keep the data in an HPR environment for\n            many years for others to reuse. Reuse of OPEDAS is costly and part and parcel of proper budgeting for\n            modern, data intensive research projects. So the actual reuse of OPEDAS in HPR formats should be eligible\n            research costs in future grants. Open data are not free in terms of ’gratis’ to reuse. This includes data\n            and data infrastructure resources that are very intensively used. These should be recognized at some point\n            as ’core infrastructure’ and partly funded as a common good and/or from reuse fees.</p>\n        <p>In the total offering of open access publishers, obviously reliable reuse of the article for in principle an\n            indefinite time is included. Storing huge data sets however, will be significantly more expensive (at least\n            initially) than storing text. So long term preservation costs need to be taken into account. There is also a\n            major difference between publishing (FAIR) data in a basic trusted repository where both people and machines\n            will be able to find them, know under which conditions to access them (the F + A of FAIR) and between\n            offering your data in fully Interoperable format, in a High Performance Reuse’ (HPR) environment. Here we\n            already warn you that HPR provision of your data to others is typically at least an order of magnitude more\n            costly in terms of hardware and accompanying service and support than just ‘publishing them’ in a format\n            that makes them principally FAIR. If your data are published, found and reused by others as OPEDAS, the new\n            user will have to bear the costs to actually include the data in a re-analytics environment. So, publishing\n            data is a different decision from maintaining (yourself) a HPR environment for them. Writing massive data to\n            ‘tape’ and storing their rich and FAIR metadata in the ‘cloud’ will be usually still considered good data\n            stewardship. The tapes can be found, accessed and the data can be retrieved in interoperable and thus\n            re-usable format, may be at significant costs, but these should be borne by the re-user. The choice of your\n            repository is extremely important though. Not only costs may differ significantly between the many emerging\n            professional data publishers, but matters of trust and solid sustainability and support issues are minimally\n            as important. In very general terms, professorware based local repositories are about the worst place to\n            publish your data, but there will be as many ’data sharks’ at the market soon as there are ’text sharks’\n            today. So be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of various data publication options and don’t take any\n            beautiful web site at face value. The general attitude you may best adopt as a good data steward in open\n            science is that money is not made on the data (as an asset with paid access0 but on services around the\n            data, including HPR services, smart analytics etc.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Publish data either internally or externally, but in all cases make sure you use reliable and\n                sustainable repositories.</p></li>\n            <li><p>If published externally, make sure to use one of the certified trusted Data Repositories and trusted\n                publishing groups.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Publish your (FAIR) metadata about the data set in a public repository, regardless of where the data\n                themselves are stored.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make a clear difference between ‘inert publishing’ and High Performance Reuse offering and budget for\n                both separately</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make extremely clear as part of the FAIR metadata under which conditions the data can and may be\n                reused (this goes way beyond a license and may for instance tell the user -frequently a machine- where\n                to find the raw data and which steps are necessary to reload them in an HPR etc.)</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Confuse archiving with publishing and ‘inert publishing’ with HPR offering.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Think that keeping data internal (even if for very good reasons like Patient privacy) relieves you\n                from the good data stewardship practice to publish rich and FAIR metadata about the internal data set in\n                a public and findable place, even if those metadata tell the potential re-user that reuse will be highly\n                restricted.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Think too easily that your data have not been produced with public funding, and therefore you are not\n                morally obliged to at least expose the metadata to the rest of the community.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Think that when you work in a private company all this does not apply to you.

However, the actual FAIR publishing of\n            data is not yet as obvious. The example of the FANTOM5 paper in the introduction is a good demonstration of\n            how data that ‘are associated with’ a paper can be an very important asset by itself, but will also cost\n            significant time and effort to be published in FAIR format (in this case nanopublications). If we stick to\n            the principle that data needs to be published in FAIR compliant formats to be optimally re-usable, separate\n            planning for the capacity and the resources to do so is part of good data stewardship. Publishing an Open\n            Access article with the actual data still being hardly Findable (hidden in supplementary data files on the\n            deep web or without proper dedicated metadata), Accessible (in non-computer readable format and without a\n            proper license) Interoperable (textual or non-community adopted identifiers) and thus very difficult to\n            reuse should be considered bad research practice.  Therefore the data on which a paper is based should be\n            published in its own right and the ‘supplementary article’ (preferably Open Access) should be regarded as\n            the description of the rationale, the methodology of the study that generated the data and the\n            <em>first</em> set of conclusions and claims based on the paper. Returning to the FANTOM5 paper, the number\n            of derivative papers based on the same dataset effectively shows the ‘bankruptcy’ of the classical\n            publication method. The data set is key and all papers (including the first ‘mothership’ paper) could\n            (should?) be seen as derivatives.</p>\n        <p>Now the question arises how much of your data can be open access. As argued before, open science requires\n            open access to be the default approach. However, there are situations where the data can not be made\n            available in open access without restriction, even if the first and all subsequent derivative textual\n            publications can be open access. For instance, data that are national security sensitive, or privacy\n            sensitive such as patient data may have to be restricted in access. Obviously, this poses a fundamental\n            issue already for peer review as the reviewers would have to ‘trust’ that the conclusions drawn in a\n            particular derivative paper are based on solid data and represent credible conclusions. Therefore, even if\n            raw data are to be restricted, a good data steward will always do everything needed and possible to provide\n            a data set (anonymized for instance or aggregated) that allows the best possible review, reproduction and\n            openness. In case the underlying raw data have to be restricted the provenance of the process that lead to\n            the ‘open data’ needs to be as comprehensive as possible and the FAIR metadata of the restricted set should\n            still be Open Access, including the Accessibility begin well explained (License, procedures to follow if\n            access to the restricted data is to be requested etc.). However, data publishing may be many orders of\n            magnitude more expensive than publshing narrative A small example: One modern instrument (for instance\n            cryo-EM) easily produces around 1 terabytes (TB) per day. Thus, a typical high-end instrument research group\n            that uses the available instrument time efficiently produces 100-300 TB per year. Typically, projects take\n            1-3 years, resulting in requirement of approximately 200-600 TB of storage for active projects. let’s assume\n            that the finder of the research requires that after completion, the data must be archived for at least 10\n            years. Thus, a data intensive research group may have to archive 2-6 petabytes of raw data over 10 years.\n            Current (academic) prices are in the range of 50 Euros/TB/year + 180 Eu/TB/year for backup and for archiving\n            108 Eu/TB/year. So storing onepeta byte. So storing 1000 terabytes in a proper way might add up to well over\n            100.000 euros/year, just for archiving. This means that a data steward needs to budget very carefully for\n            data storage archiving and back-up.</p>\n        <p>A very important decision is: what part of the data to publish where and how. Storing metadata or annotations\n            in a FAIR format and in a HPR environment is almost trivial from a cost perspective and may be enough to\n            make the actual data optimally reused.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Include resources in your study budget for the FAIR publishing of your data and/or metadata,\n                regardless of whether they can be fully open access.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Be aware that publishing of large data sets may actually be much more expensive than publishing the\n                accompanying article.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Work closely with experienced FAIR data colleagues and data publishers in- or outside your group to\n                make sure that you indeed make the best (and affordable) technological, format and terminology choices\n                that can be considered FAIR.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Choose a Trusted Data Repository to deposit the data once they are in FAIR publishable format.</p>\n            </li>\n            <li><p>Choose an appropriate license for the the data and include a machine readable identifier for that\n                license in your metadata.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make sure your data are citable.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Consider raw, processed, and metadata separately for publication choices.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Separate these data categories but ensure a resolvable permalink between them.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Publish (supplementary) data in PDF or any other non-machine readable format rendering them elusive\n                for most text mining programs.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Assume that publishing the data coming from your experiment requires a budget that is in the margin,\n                or even in the range of the APC of the articles you publish.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Publish any data without proper reference to the workflows and other research objects that were used\n                to generate and analyse them.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Publish without a serious check on price, trust and quality of the provider.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n</div>"

The\n            actual text contained the new claims and the argumentation around them. The publishing system slowly became\n            perverse as text was hidden behind firewalls (as researchers published ‘for free’) and then the reader\n            should pay. Open Access as we know it is just another business model where the ‘polluter pays’, in other\n            words, now the author pays a publication fee and the text is free to read for everyone. Much as this is an\n            improvement, it does not fundamentally support Open Science better than the old system. First, authors in\n            less fortunate institutions can not easily pay for publication and are again put in a disadvantaged\n            position. Second, there was already far too much to read anyway, now there is even more to read. Third,\n            data, the key asset for Open Science is not necessarily more Findable in Open Access papers then in closed\n            papers (the TIFF walls and the broken links are not necessarily better). Therefore <em>publishing data in\n                their own right</em> in Open Access is extremely important and a key task for a good data steward. We\n            also need to clearly distinguish between metadata and the actual data here. It can be argued that metadata\n            of any research object, regardless of whether it is an article, a data set or a piece of software should be\n            FAIR and Open Access (the A in FAIR is distinct from Open as was discussed before). There might however be\n            very good reasons to keep text or data under well defined, but restricted access. This may have routes in\n            patient privacy or national security considerations, but (especially for data generated in the private\n            sector) also reasons of competitive advantage. However, the latter is very difficult to argue for data that\n            are generated with public funding. They should be considered a public good by default and arguments to keep\n            them from reuse by others will have to be argued in any data stewardship plan with very strong arguments.  \n            Arguments to separate massive and crude data from FAIR metadata have also been discussed earlier. The raw\n            data may be too bog to keep in a High Performance Reuse (HPR) environment (typically orders of magnitude\n            more costly than for instance on tape). So in general, FAIR metadata make that your data and tools can\n            participate in the FAIR open science ecosystem.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Clearly consider for each data set whether it is considered generated by public or by private funding\n                (or a mix)</p></li>\n            <li><p>Take as the default that metadata are always FAIR, with the A being Open Access without any\n                restrictions.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make a conscious decision with the research team for the best license to put on any given data set\n                (the actual data elements.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Include the intended level of restriction in your data stewardship plan (even at the proposal stage).\n                Again for most funders the default will be Open, so in case you want to argue for a more restrictive\n                license, prepare your arguments extremely carefully as they may influence your chance to get the\n                proposal awarded.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Work wherever possible with Open Source software, but never at the expense of aspects of\n                professionalism, versioning, documentation, sustainability and (SLA) support.</p></li>\n            <li><p>When dealing with software: make your code open source under a well defined license, but consider\n                sustainability issues before doing so.

Text is usually seen as a <em>creative artifact</em> and is therefore ‘by\n            definition’ subject to copyright. About the use and abuse of copyright in the current publishing world and\n            how this jeopardises science, there is an enormous amount of recent literature and we do not feel it is\n            worthwhile to restate and discuss all arguments here. However, it is clear that ‘facts’ are not necessarily\n            subject to copyright and the question is whether ‘collection of facts’ are. Now, we try to avoid this\n            unfruitful discussion altogether because we can introduce the notion that the ‘data owner’ (whoever that is)\n            has the ‘right’ to make the data FAIR (accessible under well defined conditions). So the basic rule is:\n            never transfer right on anything to a publisher, but keep control of the access rights to your data (and\n            your articles by the way, but that is less important for data stewardship). What is more important is: Are\n            you really the legal ‘owner’ of the data you collected for your research. This may not always be the case.\n            There might me an intrinsic ownership of the data. For instance personal health data do not necessarily\n            legally belong to the data provider but at least the right to control access to the data lies with the\n            citizen participating in a study unless explicitly transferred to the researcher. So in brief: do you have\n            the authority to determine the level of accessibility of the data in question? One specific question that\n            will play a role here is, that in case you use OPEDAS in your research and they have significantly\n            contributed to the creation of your newly interpreted data and claims, that first of all you cite those\n            properly (if possible) and secondly, you make sure that re-using part of these data (if even triples in a\n            broader graph you publish) had a license that allows you to re-publish and re-distribute them. The latter is\n            different from the consent that you can use them for your research and internal analysis.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Make absolutely clear that the rightful ownership situation of the day you have collected is beyond\n                doubt.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Consult an ELSI or other legal expert in case there is any doubt about such issues.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make sure all consent rules are followed, not only on newly generated data but include OPEDAS, and\n                including required citations.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Assume that data (also OPEDAS) with no license are ‘open’ and ‘Re-usable’ by default.

As said before, narrative articles (also called ‘papers’) will likely continue to exist for\n            the foreseeable future as they still have their value. Computers can not easily cover rhetorical strings and\n            arguments and therefore narrative (although inherently ambiguous and thus not FAIR) is needed to explain to\n            people what was discerned in the data, how the data were generated and what is the basis of the conclusions.\n            Part of all this, including methods etc. can be increasingly also captured in machine actionable format and\n            therefore become part of the machine actionable FAIR ecosystem, but ‘supplementary narrative text’ with your\n            data will always be needed and obviously review articles describing a whole field etc. will always play a\n            role as long as human minds are part of the scientific process. However, when you write narrative, in\n            whichever component of what you want to publish, take care to <em>never</em> introduce ambiguous symbols and\n            formulations in the text. Narrative with synonyms and beautiful style figures may be more entertaining for\n            people to read, but these do usually not at all serve the well-defined and straightforward scientific\n            reasoning, but rather blur it. More importantly, they make text even more of a nightmare from machine\n            reading, text and data mining than they already are by their very lingual nature. Unexplained acronyms (<em>people\n                will know what I mean</em>) with multiple meanings (homonyms) alliterations, nested sentences and\n            sentences of the style [concept 1, 2, 3,4 and 5 are all related to concept 6 in table 5] are <em>absolute\n                malpractice</em> in text. In fact, a good exercise to internally check whether any narrative you add to\n            your data is reasonably unambiguous, is to ‘also’ represent as much as you can of the text in a machine\n            readable format and publish that along with the actual text. That means that if you use terms such as\n            ‘intellectual disability’ and ‘mental retardation’ interchangeably or the same symbol for a gene and its\n            corresponding protein, machines (and people alike) can at least check the unique identifier used in the\n            machine friendly version in order to ‘understand’ what you actually mean. This exercise also forces you to\n            structure your reasoning as precisely and logically as possible, so it will also improve the quality of your\n            text. Also, refer to equipment, reagents and methods with unique identifiers linked to the term, and avoid\n            using unspecific terms, jargon etc. Those sentences that cannot be represented in a machine readable format\n            even after you tried probably represent exactly that (crucial) portion of your narrative that is needed to\n            explain to other people ‘how, why, and on what basis.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Make a great effort to make any narrative you have to produce as straightforward and unambiguous as\n                possible to make it more readable for both machines and people.

More and more examples appear in the literature [references] demonstrating that new\n            discoveries can be made entirely based on ‘OPEDAS’. As the generation of new experimental data is very\n            expensive and time consuming. The rigorous questioning of the need to do so is part and parcel of good data\n            stewardship for discovery. For a data driven scientist the optimal use of OPEDAS should be a default\n            attitude. IN many cases however, you may need to create a (usually comparatively small) data set based on\n            experiments, questionnaires or other observations.

In many cases therefore, your experimental workspace will hold you <em>de novo</em> research\n            data, OPEDAS and software packages that you use to process and analyse the data.</p>\n        <p>This means that ‘active data’ like executable code may influence the workspace in a different way from\n            ‘static’ data. Software packages that are Open Source and not properly supported my seriously disrupt the\n            workspace and cause all kinds of troubles. Also, software used in the workspace may carry with it certain\n            licenses that render the processed data unusable for the purposes you had in mind with them. First of all,\n            it is therefore critically important that you never mix the loaded data for processing and analysis as they\n            are mounted in the active workspace counting as ‘one of the copies’ or even a back up. The principle\n            attitude must be that data that are actively used in the workspace will at some point be corrupted or lost\n            due to unforeseen events. But also software itself (when active) may become corrupted and may need to be\n            restored from another source in order to re-run processes and analytics.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Keep ‘static’ and safe back ups of both data and software that is mounted in the workspace</p></li>\n            <li><p>Conduct regular integrity checks on the data elements in the workspace to prevent unexpected outcomes\n                due to corruption of data, software or processes. unnoticed events may seriously slow down proper\n                experimentation, analytics and interpretation of data and you as a steward cannot expect the rest of the\n                research team to notice.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Make sure that versions of the software and workflows (including plug-ins like vocabulary services)\n                do not change unexpectedly (academics are notorious in changing things without notifying potential\n                external users).</p></li>\n            <li><p>Treat your workspace as a ‘stand alone’ and time delimited environment where you run stable data and\n                processes (so for instance no ‘remote mounting of thesauri of web services you do not control).</p></li>\n            <li><p>Keep very careful records of versions and potential issues of all elements (data as well as software)\n                that were used to run a particular process at a particular time.

However, it may also\n            be true that you need only particular components of a workflow. When workflows are based on serialised\n            components (for instance web services) that can be relatively independently deployed, it may be an option to\n            use only part of an existing workflow. However, be aware of the stability issues related to web services. In\n            case web services are maintained by academic groups, there may very well be issues related to proper\n            documentation, versioning and support that can severely hamper your experimental procedures. If the\n            reliability of the average web service is 80% (up-time, versioning etc.) and you need a sequence of 5 web\n            services to run your workflow, do the math on how likely it is that the entire workflow will run smoothly.\n            Therefore, if professional tools exist (even if they are proprietary and not Open Source) carefully study\n            and discuss the balance between using Open Source software that you can adapt yourself, its professional\n            support level (which may cost you regardless of the license situation of the software) and the use of\n            commercial software (Open Source or Closed). There is obviously a tendency in academia to use Open Source\n            software whenever possible, but this is not always adding to efficiency, just to ‘perceived freedom to hack’\n            and also sometimes based on a strong bias against ‘commercial software’ and the fear for ‘vendor lock in’.\n            These fears are not always unjustified but going for unprofessional ‘hacks’ just to save some money (in the\n            short term) or based on your desire to be able to ‘change and tweak’ things yourself (or even worse, purely\n            motivated by the desire to publish on something new <em>per se</em>) may not at all be the best servant for\n            your research team. Laboratory analysts would be punished immediately if they crafted their test tubes\n            themselves or made their reagents in a non GLP environment, so why would that be acceptable for data\n            analysts? So the choice of workflow engine is as much a team choice (with your advise) as the choice to use\n            reagents such as antibodies from a commercial (guaranteed) provider versus producing them in the lab by\n            immunising mice. Questions to be answered in the process of choosing an existing workflow, engine or service\n            include considerations about the ease of custom developments. For instance; can a workflow be edited\n            collaboratively, can you reach out to and collaborate with the developers? Does it support the compute back\n            ends you need?, does it offer standard tools for the administrative operations? What is the ease of adding\n            new tools, does it support nesting of workflows? is it easy to use, also for non-computer experts, for\n            instance does it have a running and easy GUI?</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"do\">\n        <h2>Do</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Check the various workflow options and engines, not only for promised functionality but also for:</p>\n            </li>\n            <li><p>Level of documentation, support, licensing and reliability.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Keep in mind that your final responsibility is the quality of the processed data, not to make new\n                algorithms.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Get in direct contact with the workflow engine provider and follow training if necessary.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Run the workflow, engine, pipeline on exemplar data first.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Take the ‘running’ environment into account and check the sustainability of that environment (for\n                instance Galaxy)</p></li>\n            <li><p>check who in the team will have to operate the workflow (experimentalists and ICT people may prefern\n                very different UI’s)</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"dont\">\n        <h2>Don't</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><p>Develop new workflows or workflow engines unless demonstrably unavoidable and consented by the\n                team.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Use unsupported tools or environments ‘just because they are easy to access and OS’.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Discard the idea to use commercial or otherwise proprietary workflows without careful consideration\n                and discussion with the rest of the team, especially when your data are difficult to reproduce.</p></li>\n            <li><p>Expect purely academically published and ‘provided’ workflows and web services to be ‘up and running’\n                all the time and consider an entire workflow as one unit, without inspecting all serial elements of it\n                for reliability and usefulness.</p></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"links\">\n        <h2>Links</h2>\n\n        <ul>\n            <li><a href=\"https://github.com/DSQResources/DSQ-ydj\" target=\"_blank\">DS Question GitHub resources repository: ydj</a></li>\n        </ul>\n    </section>\n</div>"
